# Use SIP with Twilio Voice

## Before you Begin

Before you can use SIP Interface, you must sign up for a Twilio account (if you don't already have one). To sign up for an account click [here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).

## Overview

Connect your communications infrastructure to Twilio and start building programmable voice applications, such as call centers and IVRs, with Twilio's powerful and flexible voice capabilities. You can connect to Twilio over the public internet or alternatively via a private connection using [Twilio's Interconnect](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/interconnect). Programmable Voice SIP lets you route your voice calls with global reach to any landline phone, mobile phone, browser, mobile app, or any other SIP endpoint.

The following diagram illustrates how the Twilio Cloud can sit in-between your existing infrastructure in call flows, allowing you to build programmable voice applications. Twilio is able to programmatically handle incoming calls from the PSTN and sessions from your SIP communications infrastructure such as a PBX.

## What is SIP?

[Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)](/docs/glossary/what-is-session-initiation-protocol-sip) is a standardized communications protocol that has been widely adopted for managing multimedia communication sessions for voice and video calls. SIP may be used to establish connectivity between your communications infrastructures such as an on-premise or virtual PBX and Twilio's communications platform.

### Sending SIP to Twilio

Twilio's Programmable Voice SIP Interface product enables you to use your existing SIP communications infrastructure to initiate SIP sessions with the Twilio Cloud. SIP Interface uses Twilio's [TwiML](/docs/voice/twiml) language and/or Twilio's [REST](/docs/usage/api) APIs to create advanced voice applications. Learn how to get started [connecting your SIP communications infrastructure to the Twilio Cloud](/docs/voice/api/sending-sip).

### Receiving SIP from Twilio

Twilio's Programmable Voice SIP Interface product enables your advanced voice applications to initiate SIP sessions from the Twilio Cloud towards your existing SIP communications infrastructure using Twilio's [TwiML](/docs/voice/twiml) language and/or Twilio's [REST](/docs/usage/api) APIs. Learn how to get started [connecting the Twilio Cloud to your SIP communications infrastructure](/docs/voice/api/receiving-sip).

### Limits

Make sure you are aware of the following Programmable Voice SIP Domain limits.

* 100 SIP Domains per Account or Sub Account
* [IP Access Control Lists (ACLs) limits](/docs/voice/sip/api/sip-ipaccesscontrollist-resource)
* [Credential Lists limits](/docs/voice/sip/api/sip-credentiallist-resource)
* [SIP Registration limits](/docs/voice/api/sip-registration#limits)

## Features

### SIP Registration

Twilio allows you to register your SIP Phones or SIP Endpoints with Twilio. SIP Registration is used to identify the location of the SIP Endpoints. Therefore, the user can receive calls irrespective of physical location of the SIP Endpoint.

This feature allows your SIP Endpoints can send REGISTER request to Twilio. For details see [here](/docs/voice/api/sip-registration).

### Call Transfers using SIP REFER from Twilio

Call transfer enables you to move an active call from one endpoint to another, in SIP this is accomplished using the SIP REFER method.

Twilio supports initiating SIP REFER method from Twilio towards your IP communications infrastructure leveraging the [\<Refer>](/docs/voice/twiml/refer) verb.

### SIP Custom Header

[SIP custom header](/docs/voice/api/sending-sip#sip-custom-headers) allows you to send customized headers.

### UUI (User-to-User Information) Header

UUI header allows you to send contextual information over the SIP call. You can check [Sending-sip with UUI](/docs/voice/api/sending-sip#uui-user-to-user-information-header) and [Receiving-sip with UUI](/docs/voice/api/receiving-sip#uui-user-to-user-information-header) for further UUI details.

### DTMF

Twilio supports [RFC-2833](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2833.txt) for sending and receiving DTMF.

### Media codec

Twilio supports [G.711 μ-law (PCMU) and A-law (PCMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.711#.CE.BC-Law) codecs for media. These are the most popular codecs used by carriers so transcoding is unnecessary.

### Securing SIP Traffic using TLS

Encryption ensures that the call signaling remains private during transmission. Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides encryption for SIP signaling.

In order for this to function properly, devices in your network that communicate directly with Twilio must be configured to trust Twilio's TLS/SSL Certificate. Twilio uses certificates issued by a CA (Certificate Authority). You may need to add additional root certificates to your communications infrastructure to establish the authenticity of Twilio's certificate on the network. [Download Twilio's bundle of trusted CA certificates](/documents/ca-bundle-sip.crt) (last updated September 1, 2023).

Note: the current bundle contains the following root certificates:

* DigiCert Global Root CA
* DigiCert Global Root G2
* DigiCert Global Root G3

The Twilio CA bundle may be updated in the future, for example when root certificates expire or are distrusted by the CA. In such cases we will notify you to update your SIP devices. Ensure that your email address is up to date in your account to ensure you receive such communication.

There is no further configuration required for TLS and you can start sending over port 5061 straight away. TLS support via port 5061 is always active and does not require a manual toggle like Secure Media.

For calls where TLS is active this will cause SIP PCAPs downloaded from the console to be empty.

*When sending TLS SIP traffic to Twilio, you will need to ensure that your infrastructure is using next-hop domain as opposed to next-hop ip. This is a common misconfiguration and will cause a 403 error that will not be visible on your Twilio account. Traffic must be sent to the domain `{example}.sip.{edge}.twilio.com`, rather than an IP address in order to associate the traffic with your Twilio account.*

#### TLS Specifications

* **Supported TLS versions:** `TLSv1.2` and above. \
  To comply with industry-standard security requirements, Twilio no longer supports `TLSv1.0` and `TLSv1.1` for inbound or outbound Elastic SIP Trunking calls and SIP registration.
* **Supported Ciphers:** `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384`, `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384`, `AES128-GCM-SHA256`, `AES128-SHA256`, `AES128-SHA`, `AES256-GCM-SHA384`, `AES256-SHA256`, `AES256-SHA`

> \[!NOTE]
>
> Note: Twilio SIP Interface outbound call URI configurations using the `sips` URI scheme in order to enable end-to-end encryption is NOT supported by Twilio. However, we do support `sip` URI schemes using `transport=tls` for point-to-point encryption.
>
> If you configure your SIP Interface URIs to use `sips` schemes, these `sips` URIs will be handled as if they were `sip` URIs using TLS transport. Twilio will effectively adjust the URI internally to instead be routed using the `sip` scheme and `transport=tls` on the outbound messages, resulting in point-to-point encryption between Twilio and the customer equipment.
>
> Twilio strongly suggests not using `sips` schemes in your Twilio SIP configurations, as this could cause possibly unintended behavior, due to how we process such URIs. Instead, we suggest using `sip` schemes with TLS transport. This method, along with the security of our voice architecture and Super Network, is an effective way of adding encryption to your Twilio SIP connections.

### Secure Media

Secure Media uses encryption to ensure that the call media and associated signaling remains private during transmission. Secure Real-Time Protocol (SRTP) provides encryption for media. For details see [here](/docs/voice/api/secure-media).

## IP addresses

Prepare your communications infrastructure to make sure that your SIP infrastructure has connectivity to the Twilio Cloud and vice versa. To ensure that your communications infrastructure doesn't block communication, you must update your list of allowed IP addresses. We strongly encourage you to allow all of the following IP address ranges and ports on your firewall for SIP signaling and RTP media traffic.

*This is important if you have Numbers in different regions as well as for availability purposes (e.g. if North America Virginia gateways are down, then North America Oregon gateways will be used).*

See Twilio's [SIP IP addresses](/docs/sip-trunking/ip-addresses) for the complete list.
