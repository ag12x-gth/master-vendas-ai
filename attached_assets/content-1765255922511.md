# Call Notification via Webhook

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Call Notification via Webhook feature is currently available as a Private Beta product, and Twilio may change the information in this document at any time. This means that some features aren't yet implemented, and others may change before the product becomes Generally Available. Private Beta products aren't covered by a Service Level Agreement.

## How incoming calls work now

The Twilio Programmable Voice Android and iOS SDKs use platform push notifications, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and Apple VoIP Service for iOS, for delivering incoming call notifications. The application developers need to provide their cloud messaging credentials or certificates to Twilio (stored as Push Credentials) to be used for authentication when Twilio sends the push notification delivery requests to FCM or APN. In order to receive incoming call push notifications, an app user needs to first register a push binding, which indicates the mobile client is active ready for incoming calls. Upon receiving the push notification, the application uses the Android `Voice.handleMessage()` method or the iOS `TwilioVoiceSDK.handleNotification()` method and passes the push notification payload. A call-invite-received callback event will be raised to the application so the user can choose to accept or reject the call.

There are a few limitations with the current solution:

* Twilio Voice mobile SDK only supports FCM and Apple VoIP Service. Developers have been asking if they can use different types of push services, for example the regular APN notification for iOS, which does not share the PushKit-CallKit requirement as the Apple VoIP Service notification does, or even manage the delivery themselves.
* Developers need to provide their cloud messaging service credentials to Twilio, which may raise concerns for the developers.
* There is no API for client binding management. The only way to delete a binding created by the Voice mobile SDK is using the SDK `Voice.unregister()` method.
  * Developers sometimes receive Twilio notifications about push notification delivery failure because the information inside the bindings are longer valid, but cannot do much.
  * The application needs to be run on the specific device in order to retrieve the same device token used for creating the binding unless similar binding information (identity, device token, etc) is stored in the application's database.
  * Without a binding management API it's very difficult to perform batch binding CRUD operations.

## New call notification via webhook

We are introducing the new Call Notification Webhook feature. Once configured, the developer's webhook endpoint will receive incoming call notifications every time calls are made to the clients under their account. Application developers are responsible for delivering the call notifications to their clients, via the channels that are best suited for their application such as push notification or web socket.

Below are a few requirements on the application developers' side in order to adopt the feature:

* Configure the webhook
* Client "binding" management
* Set up a webhook endpoint to handle call delivery requests

**Webhook configuration**

To create a default configuration with the webhook URL, see the [Client resource](/docs/voice/api/clientconfiguration-resource).

**Client binding management**

In order to deliver call notifications to app users, the application developers should maintain a list of active clients. Each active client entry should contain:

* Client identity: if the identity matches the call receiver identity inside the webhook request body, the app developer should send a notification to this client. Note that Twilio currently allows multiple client instances to have the same identity (under the same Twilio account). When a call is made to this client identity, all instances with the same identity should receive the call notification.
* Twilio Account SID: the call notification sent from Twilio will indicate that the call is made for the clients under a specific Twilio account. Only client instances under this account should receive the call notification.
* (Optional) Unique device identifier: depending on the delivery mechanism chosen by the application developer, there should be a unique identifier which can be associated with a specific device. For example, a device token for sending push notifications to an Android or iOS app.
* (Optional) Unique binding identifier: makes it easier in case client binding information needs to be updated or deleted.

**Webhook handler**

An endpoint to receive HTTP `POST` requests with information about the call notification. The application endpoint should return a response:

* `200 OK`: client instance with matching identity and Twilio Account SID is found and call notification dispatched to the client.
* `404 Not Found`: no client with the same identity and Twilio Account SID can be found.

The body of the `POST` request consists of several key parameters of the call in JSON format:

```json
{
    "twi_account_sid": ACxxxx,
    "twi_bridge_token": "eyJraxxxx",
    "twi_call_sid": CAxxxx,
    "twi_from": "client:alice",
    "twi_message_id": WBxxxx,
    "twi_message_type": "twilio.voice.call",
    "twi_to": "client:bob"
}
```

Parameters:

If bindings matching both the Account SID and the callee identity are found, deliver the JSON body directly, without modification, to the clients through the most suitable communication channel for the application's use case, such as push notifications or web sockets. The mobile application will then pass the payload to the Android `Voice.handleMessage()` method or the iOS `TwilioVoiceSDK.handleNotification()` method upon receiving the notification, just like how it works when Twilio sends the incoming call notifications via push notification, and an incoming call invite will be raised to the application for the user to answer.

Here's an example in Python for handling a webhook request and sending the notification payload to the mobile client via push notification:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, Response
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/calls/notificationWebhook", methods=["POST"])
def call_notification_webhook():
    try:
        notification_payload = request.json
    except:
        notification_payload = None
        logging.error("error in parsing request form data as JSON: \n{}".format(sys.exc_info()[0]))
        return Response(status=400, mimetype="text/plain")

    # Get the callee identity
    twilio_to = notification_payload["twi_to"]
    twilio_to_components = twilio_to.split(':')
    if len(twilio_to_components) == 2:
        callee_client_identity = twilio_to_components[1]
    else:
        logging.error("error parsing the callee identity in twi_to")
        callee_client_identity = None

    # Get the Twilio Account SID
    twilio_account_sid = notification_payload["twi_account_sid"]

    if not callee_client_identity:
        return Response("Invalid callee identity", status=400, mimetype="text/plain")

    global binding_data
    # Use the identity and account SID for binding lookup
    bindings = binding_data.get_bindings_by_identity(callee_client_identity, twilio_account_sid)

    if not len(bindings):
        response = Response('Not found', status=404, mimetype="text/plain")
        return response

    for binding in bindings:
        # Send a push notification to this client
        notification_webhook_processor.notification_dispatch(binding, notification_payload)

    response = Response(status=200, mimetype="text/plain")
    return response

```
