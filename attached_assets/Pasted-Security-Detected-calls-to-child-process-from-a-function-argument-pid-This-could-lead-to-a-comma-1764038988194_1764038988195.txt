Detected calls to child_process from a function argument `pid`. This could lead to a command injection if the input is user controllable. Try to avoid calls to child_process, and if it is needed ensure user input is correctly sanitized or sandboxed.

Bcrypt Hash detected. Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in connection strings as this creates security risks. Instead, use environment variables to store and access credentials at runtime. If you need the actual credential values to make this work properly, ask me to provide them through Replit's secret system.

Replace pool.query(), db.execute() and sql.raw() calls with Drizzle's recommended sql`...` template literals or Drizzle's query builders. This is a required coding standard for all Drizzle projects regardless of context (including migrations). Raw string queries violate framework conventions and must be converted to maintain codebase consistency and type safety.

The call to 'createDecipheriv' with the Galois Counter Mode (GCM) mode of operation is missing an expected authentication tag length. If the expected authentication tag length is not specified or otherwise checked, the application might be tricked into verifying a shorter-than-expected authentication tag. This can be abused by an attacker to spoof ciphertexts or recover the implicit authentication key of GCM, allowing arbitrary forgeries.
