Agent’s self-testing feature that validates your app’s functionality using an actual browser, with visual feedback and automatic issue resolution.

App Testing is a powerful new feature in Agent 3 that allows Agent to test itself using an actual browser. Agent tests the apps it builds by navigating through your application like a real user would, clicking around and validating functionality. This self-testing capability helps ensure your app works correctly and allows Agent to catch and fix issues automatically.
New in Agent 3: App Testing represents a major advancement in Agent’s autonomous capabilities, enabling more reliable and higher-quality app development.
​
How App Testing works
When App Testing is enabled, Agent will periodically decide to test itself when it thinks enough has changed to deem it necessary. Agent doesn’t test after 100% of user messages, but intelligently determines when testing would be most valuable.
Watch App Testing in action as Agent navigates through your app:
​
Key Benefits
Extended Autonomy: Enables Agent to work for longer periods without requiring human intervention
Higher Quality: Produces apps with fewer mistakes by identifying and addressing issues early
Cost Efficiency: Prevents the need for additional debugging sessions by catching problems during development
Interactive Review: Provides video replays and section-by-section navigation for thorough result analysis
​
The Testing Process
When Agent decides to test itself, here’s what happens:
Browser Preview: You’ll see a browser preview within the Agent pane
Visual Testing: Watch Agent’s cursor as it clicks around your app, testing functionality
Real User Simulation: Agent navigates through your application just like a real user would, entering mock data when necessary
Automatic Analysis: Agent analyzes the test results and identifies any issues
Self-Correction: Agent reports back with a summary of its tests and automatically fixes any issues that crop up
​
Key capabilities
Agent intelligently tests your application by navigating through it like a real user would, covering:
User interface validation: Buttons, forms, navigation, and visual elements
Functionality verification: Core features and user workflows
Integration testing: API calls, database interactions, and third-party services
Performance and accessibility: Load times, responsiveness, and accessibility standards
​
Usage
App Testing can be toggled on/off within the “Agent Tools” section of the input box within your Repl. When enabled, Agent intelligently decides when to test based on the changes made to your app.
App Testing is part of Agent 3’s autonomous capabilities. Learn more about Autonomy Level settings and other Agent features.

Take over
Sometimes the Agent will encounter a roadblock during testing that it needs your help with to continue. Most commonly this involves logging in to a user account (e.g. Gmail). In these cases, the Agent will pop up with a button to “Begin take over.”

Pressing “Begin take over” enables you to click into the testing preview, complete the requisite steps, then allow the Agent to continue. You can also press “Skip” to skip take over, ending the App Testing if the Agent cannot proceed without your help. If you do not respond within 10 minutes, the Agent will continue as if you pressed “Skip.”
​
What to expect
Skip option: Use the skip button to bypass testing if needed and continue with development
Interactive video replay: After testing, click the video to replay the entire testing session
Section navigation: Use the sliders at the bottom to jump to specific sections of the test
The interactive replay interface allows you to review the complete testing session:

Troubleshooting
Tests failing unexpectedly
Try skipping then prompting again to test
Check for dynamic content that might affect test timing
Review test scenarios for accuracy
Missing test coverage
Provide more detailed descriptions of your app’s functionality
Explicitly mention critical user flows that should be tested
