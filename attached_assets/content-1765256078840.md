## Authenticate API requests

[authenticate-api-requests page anchor](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversational-intelligence/api#authenticate-api-requests)

Positive FeedbackNegative Feedback

To authenticate requests to the Twilio APIs, Twilio supports [HTTP Basic authentication(link takes you to an external page)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication "HTTP Basic authentication"). Use your _API key_ as the username and your _API key secret_ as the password. You can create an API key either [in the Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api-keys/keys-in-console "in the Twilio Console") or [using the API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api-keys/key-resource-v1 "using the API").

**Note**: Twilio recommends using API keys for authentication in production apps. For local testing, you can use your Account SID as the username and your Auth token as the password. You can find your Account SID and Auth Token in the [Twilio Console(link takes you to an external page)](https://www.twilio.com/console "Twilio Console").

Learn more about [Twilio API authentication](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/requests-to-twilio "Twilio API authentication").

### Restricted API keys

[restricted-api-keys page anchor](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversational-intelligence/api#restricted-api-keys)

Positive FeedbackNegative Feedback

You can use [Restricted API keys](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api-keys/restricted-api-keys "Restricted API keys") with Conversational Intelligence for fine-grained control over API resources. For example, you can provide permissions for an API key to only modify [Intelligence Service resources](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversational-intelligence/api/service-resource "Intelligence Service resources"), but not access potentially-sensitive information such as unredacted [Transcript Media subresources](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversational-intelligence/api/transcript-media-subresource "Transcript Media subresources"), [Transcript resources](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversational-intelligence/api/transcript-resource "Transcript resources"), or [Transcript OperatorResults subresources](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversational-intelligence/api/transcript-operator-results-subresource "Transcript OperatorResults subresources").

For more information on Twilio's REST API, refer to the Usage documentation on [sending requests](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/requests-to-twilio "sending requests"), [API responses](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/twilios-response "API responses"), and [security](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/security "security").
