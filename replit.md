# Master IA Oficial

## Overview
Master IA Oficial is a comprehensive WhatsApp and SMS mass messaging control panel with AI automation capabilities. It provides a centralized platform for managing multi-channel campaigns, customer service conversations, contact management (CRM), and AI-driven chatbots using Meta's WhatsApp Business API and Baileys. The project aims to be an all-in-one solution for automated, intelligent communication, offering an intuitive dashboard for businesses, including an AI-powered lead progression system and a Kanban lead management system.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Socket.IO.
- **Backend**: Node.js 18+ (Express custom server), Next.js API Routes (REST), Socket.IO 4.8.1, Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL), JWT authentication.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon hosted) for primary data, separate PostgreSQL with `pgvector` for AI embeddings.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Meta Cloud API and Baileys library.
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis (Upstash) for real-time caching and BullMQ message queue, with fallback to in-memory cache.

### Core Architectural Decisions
- **Dual WhatsApp Connection Strategy**: Supports both Meta API and local Baileys (QR code) connections with a hybrid messaging system.
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for instant updates.
- **AI Personas and Automation Engine**: Persona-based design with OpenAI provider and RAG capabilities via a vector database. Includes AI-powered automatic lead progression and humanized AI response delays.
- **Campaign Management**: Custom queue system with rate limiting, retry logic, dedicated Baileys mass campaign system, and automated cadence (drip campaign) system. Includes full pause/resume functionality for campaigns.
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive data at rest.
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Company-based tenant model ensuring data isolation.
- **Webhook System**: Meta Webhooks with signature verification and a production-ready custom webhooks integration with HMAC SHA256 and exponential retry logic.
- **Kanban Lead Management System**: Interactive Kanban board with full CRUD operations, drag-and-drop functionality, and automatic appointment notifications when leads move to scheduling stages.
- **Analytics Dashboard System**: Comprehensive real-time analytics with KPI metrics, time-series charts, funnel visualization, and voice call analytics.
- **Template Management System**: Full CRUD interface for message templates with dynamic variable support.
- **UI/UX Component Library**: Reusable ShadCN-based components, including skeleton loaders, empty states, server-side pagination, debounced search inputs, and a centralized toast notification helper.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Mobile-first PWA implementation with offline support, app manifest, and standalone display mode.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Caching, dynamic imports, Redis cache optimization, PostgreSQL indexes, BullMQ for queuing, rate limiting middleware, and Prometheus metrics with alerting.
- **Atendimentos Page Performance**: Optimized conversation and message loading with pagination (50 items per page), infinite scroll, parallel API calls (Promise.all), and cursor-based message pagination using ISO timestamps.
- **API Cache Singleflight Pattern**: Prevents cache stampede by reusing in-flight promises for concurrent requests to the same cache key.
- **Parallel Query Execution**: Dashboard stats, campaigns, and connection health APIs use Promise.all for parallel database/external API calls.
- **Tiered Cache TTLs**: STATUS_POLLING (2.5s), SHORT (30s), MEDIUM (60s), LONG (5min) for different data freshness requirements.
- **OAuth Authentication System**: Production-ready OAuth 2.0 with Google and Facebook via NextAuth.js, supporting account linking and multi-tenant compatibility.
- **Atomic Lua Script Rate Limiting**: Atomic rate limiting implementation using Lua scripts in Redis/EnhancedCache.
- **Proactive Token Monitoring**: Meta access token expiration monitoring.
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Global listener registration flag.

### Deployment Configuration
- **Deployment Type**: VM (Persistent) for Socket.IO, BullMQ, and Baileys.
- **Health Check**: `/health` and `/_health` endpoints.
- **Port**: 5000.
