# Master IA Oficial

## Overview
Master IA Oficial is a comprehensive WhatsApp and SMS mass messaging control panel with AI automation capabilities. It provides a centralized platform for managing multi-channel campaigns, customer service conversations, contact management (CRM), and AI-driven chatbots using Meta's WhatsApp Business API and Baileys. The project aims to be an all-in-one solution for automated, intelligent communication, offering an intuitive dashboard for businesses, including an AI-powered lead progression system and a Kanban lead management system.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The platform is built with a modern web stack, featuring **Next.js 14** (App Router) for the frontend, **Node.js 18+** with Express for the backend, and **PostgreSQL** (Neon) for data persistence, including `pgvector` for AI embeddings. **Socket.IO** enables real-time communication, while **Redis** (Upstash) handles caching and **BullMQ** manages message queues.

**Core Architectural Decisions include:**
- **Dual WhatsApp Connection Strategy**: Supports both Meta API and local Baileys (QR code) for WhatsApp integration.
- **AI Automation Engine**: Features persona-based AI with OpenAI, RAG via a vector database, and AI-powered lead progression.
- **Campaign Management**: Includes a custom queue, rate limiting, retry logic, dedicated Baileys mass campaign system, and automated cadence (drip campaign) with SMS duplication protection.
- **Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data and multi-tenant architecture ensuring data isolation.
- **Webhooks**: Meta Webhooks with signature verification and custom webhooks with HMAC SHA256 and exponential retry.
- **Kanban Lead Management System**: Provides an interactive board with CRUD and drag-and-drop functionalities.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Offers real-time KPIs, time-series charts, and funnel visualization, including voice call analytics.
- **UI/UX**: Utilizes ShadCN UI for reusable components, server-side pagination, debounced search, and toast notifications. The application is designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
- **Performance Optimizations**: Achieved through caching, dynamic imports, Redis, PostgreSQL indexes, BullMQ, and API Cache Singleflight patterns.
- **Conversation Optimization**: Optimized loading of conversations and messages with pagination, infinite scroll, and parallel API calls.
- **Voice AI System**: Integrates Retell.ai for automated calls, with agents managed in a local database (`voice_agents`). It supports both inbound and outbound calls, with specific Twilio TwiML configurations for bidirectional audio streaming (Dial to SIP URI method).
- **Authentication**: Production-ready OAuth 2.0 with Google and Facebook via NextAuth.js.
- **Deployment**: Configured for VM (Persistent) for real-time components and has a `/health` endpoint.

- **OpenAI**: Provides GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4o models via `@ai-sdk/openai`.
- **PostgreSQL with pgvector**: Used as a vector database for AI embeddings.
- **Neon**: Hosted PostgreSQL database.
